# Organisation-Committee of Pizza4Python 

This is an example of repository workflow/version-control for Pizza4Python attendees who are getting started. :)

Info below for people wanting to get involved in the organisation of Pizza4Python events.
We are currently searching for contributors who would like to attend on a regular basis... With a pool of 10-20 regular contributors, we'd likely need less than 5-10 hours of input per contributor each month.

# There are 3 specific aims for P4P drop-ins:
  
 Beginners can successfully self-guide their own learning at Headphone Haven
 Programmers at all levels can join forces or propose projects @ Collab Central
 We provide a platform to invite interesting speakers and to host programming workshops for VU life scientistis


# >>> We need Pizza4Python Contributors for the following roles:

## 1. Hosts 
  
A host makes sure the P4P event runs smoothly.
Before P4P:       
The host can schedule and invite speakers and will ensure we have enough tutors present on the evening.
During P4P:           
The host should arrive by 5pm and try to leave with the last person, no later than 8.30pm. 
Ensure O2 building security remains happy with us and allows us to continue to host P4P evenings.
The host is the point-of-contact for the speaker and volunteer tutors on that P4P evening. 
The host should set & clean up the room, welcome attendees and newcomers by explaining the P4P concept. 
Order and follow up pizza delivery by 5.30pm. 

## 2. Volunteer Tutors
 
A tutor has programming experience and likes mentoring people. 
Ideally we'd have at least 2 tutors present at the event if it is busy between 5.30-7.30pm. Mainly, tutors are there to offer help during troubleshooting, or to answer questions. Ideally, during the pizza break the tutors can give a short 5-10 minute workshop, especially if there is no speaker scheduled. Tutors can talk about a recent problem/project they worked on and subsequently overcame. Or it could be as simple as explaining a new function or feature/concept/trend they came across.

## 3. Speakers
 
A speaker may be invited by a host or volunteer themselves to give a workshop or talk to the P4P attendees.
The speaker may hold a talk or workshop during a P4P event. Ideally the speaker can tell attendees about something new and useful, either for data analysis, ongoing P4P projects, or for career/industry possibilities outside academia. If possible the workshop should be engaging and/or interactive for P4P attendees of a broad background. In other words, the workshop should be accessible for both beginners and advanced programmers, and should be relatable to life scientists of any domain. If the speaker plans to speak for more than 30-minutes, this should be agreed upon in advance.
                      
## 4. Project Masters
  
  A project master comes to P4P with a science project in mind for collaboration.
The project master should provide a short description of the project from the outset, state its goals, and a basic outline for what success/progress could be measured. The project master can recruit interested attendees either using our website, or just writing it up on the night. If the project is complex and spans multiple weeks and meetings, then the project master should be willing to attend frequently or provide tutors and feedback along the way. Learning by doing remains central to our projects, so try to have programmers at different skill levels on every team.
                      
            
>>>Thank you, happy Programming!
